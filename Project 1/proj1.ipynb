The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

Then, within each group (**stratum**), members are randomly selected into the final probability sample, which is often a simple random sample (SRS). This method is called **stratified sampling**. \n",

Now we would like to survey 120 students to hear their thoughts on the midterm exam. One of the TAs proposed to do a stratified sampling; he grouped students by their standings - freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, graduate (5 **strata** in total) - and randomly chose 24 students in each group (**stratum**), and survey these 120 students. \n",

    "\n",
    "Different from stratified sampling, in some cases we may not need a member from each group (stratum). Another way to utilize the information we have about the population is cluster sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "In cluster sampling, the population is also first divided into groups, called **clusters**, based on prior known information. Note that in cluster sampling, every member of the population is assigned to one, and only one, cluster. A sample of clusters is then chosen, using a probability method (often simple random sampling). All members of the selected clusters will be in the final probability sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "**EXAMPLE:**\n",
    "In Spring 2019, there were 800 students enrolled in Data 100, each of whom signed up for 1 of the 35 sections. Another TA proposed to do a cluster sampling; there were 35 sections that each has 25 seats. She randomly selected 5 sections (clusters); she didn't know how many students were there in each of these 5 sections (clusters). She ended up surveying 119 students. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's try collect a cluster sample of business IDs, where each cluster is a postal code, with 5 clusters in the sample. Assign `bus_cluster_sample` to a series of business IDs selected by this sampling procedure. Reminder: Use the `postal_code_5` column.\n",

    "\n",
    "In question 5a, we counted the number of null values per ZIP code. Reminder: we still only use the zip codes found in `sf_dense_zip`. Let's now count the proportion of null values of longitudinal coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new dataframe of counts of the null and proportion of null values, storing the result in `fraction_missing_df`. It should have an index called `postal_code_5` and should also have 3 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",
    "2. `count non null`: The number of present values for the zip code.\n",
    "3. `fraction null`: The fraction of values that are null for the zip code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data frame should be sorted by the fraction null in descending order. The first two rows of your answer should include postal code 94107 and 94124.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended approach: Build three series with the appropriate names and data and then combine them into a dataframe. This will require some new syntax you may not have seen. You already have code from question 4a that computes the `null count` series.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pursue this recommended approach, you might find these two functions useful and you aren't required to use these two:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rename`: Renames the values of a series.\n",
    "* `pd.concat`: Can be used to combine a list of Series into a dataframe. Example: `pd.concat([s1, s2, s3], axis=1)` will combine series 1, 2, and 3 into a dataframe. Be careful about `axis=1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: You can use the divison operator to compute the ratio of two series.\n",

    "*Hint*: The - operator can invert a boolean array. Or alternately, the `notnull` method can be used to create a boolean array from a series.\n",

    "Let's look at the distribution of inspection scores. As we saw before when we called `head` on this data frame, inspection scores appear to be integer values. The discreteness of this variable means that we can use a barplot to visualize the distribution of the inspection score. Make a bar plot of the counts of the number of inspections receiving each score. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should look like the image below. It does not need to look exactly the same (e.g., no grid), but make sure that all labels and axes are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Use `plt.bar()` for plotting. See [PyPlot tutorial](http://data100.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-sync?repo=https://github.com/DS-100/su19&subPath=lab/lab01/pyplot.ipynb) from Lab01 for other references, such as labeling.\n",

    "We can see from the plot that the mode appears to the restaurants that received the highest rating. And most restaurants receive a high score for the inspections. There are an unsually high number of restaurants with high scores; however, that can be partially explained by the idea that good score implies safer restaurant. This implies that the scores are reflective of restaurant's quality of health. "

    "Let's figure out which restaurants had the worst scores ever (single lowest score). Let's start by creating a new dataframe called `ins_named`. It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "*Hint*: Use the merge method to join the `ins` dataframe with the appropriate portion of the `bus` dataframe. See the official [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html) on how to use `merge`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
